# 🎯 Number Guessing Game in JavaScript

Welcome to the **Number Guessing Game**! This is a simple logic-based game where the computer selects a random number between 0 and 100, and the player has to guess it.

## 🕹️ Features
- **Random Number Generation:** Uses `Math.random()` to generate a new challenge every time.
- **Smart Hints:** Tells the user if their guess is "Too Big" or "Too Small".
- **Infinite Loop:** The game continues until you find the correct number.

## 🛠️ How it Works
1. The computer picks a number between 0 and 100.
2. The user is prompted to enter a guess.
3. If the guess is correct, the user wins! 🏆
4. If not, the game provides a hint and asks for another guess.

## 🚀 How to Run
### Using Browser Console:
1. Open any web browser (Chrome, Firefox).
2. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools.
3. Go to the **Console** tab.
4. Copy and paste the code from `index.js` and press Enter.

### Using Node.js:
> **Note:** Since `prompt()` is a browser function, if you run this in Node.js/GitHub Codespaces, you will need to replace `prompt` with a library like `prompt-sync`.
